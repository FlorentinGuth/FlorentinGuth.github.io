# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I'm a Faculty Fellow in the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at NYU and a Research Fellow in the [Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/) at the Flatiron Institute. I'm interested in making a science of deep learning, e.g., understand how it escapes the curse of dimensionality, particularly in the context of image generative models.

I'm a Faculty Fellow in the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at NYU and a Research Fellow in the [Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/) at the Flatiron Institute. I'm interested in making a science of deep learning, e.g., understand how it escapes the curse of dimensionality, particularly in the context of image generative models.

Between 2019 and 2023, I was completing my PhD at [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.di.ens.fr/) in Paris under the supervision of [Stéphane Mallat](https://www.di.ens.fr/~mallat/mallat.html), entitled _Towards a Mathematical Understanding of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks_. You can find my thesis [here](uploads/thesis.pdf) and the defense slides [here](uploads/defense.pdf).
